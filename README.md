# Fish-Weight-Prediction
This project aims to predict the weight of fish based on various features such as species, length, width, and height. The weight of fish is an important metric in the fishing industry for assessing the quality and value of the catch. By building a predictive model, we can assist fishermen and fisheries in estimating the weight of fish more accurately, leading to better decision-making and resource management.
